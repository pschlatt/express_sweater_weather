# Express Sweater Weather:
<details>
<summary> Project Digest </summary>
<p>

This project is an introduction to building an Express API using JavaScript and NodeJS.  I wrote a very similar project that contains the same endpoints, but it was written in RoR.  Express Sweater Weather was an opportunity to adapt my fundamental programming knowledge from Ruby to Javascript using NodeJS.

Additional Goals:

- Utilize a project board to create and track details for project completion
- Practice written technical communication with concise and consistent git commits and clear pull requests
- Clearly document Introduction, Initial Setup, How to Use, Known Issues, Running Tests, How to Contribute, Core Contributors, Schema Design, and Tech Stack List
- Implement testing using Jest
